## Tools and Technologies

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS  
- **Package Management:** APT  
- **Security Tools:** Nmap, OpenSSH, UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)  
- **Utilities:** SSH, Nano, Systemctl

## System Updates and Package Installation

### Description  
Updated the system and installed necessary packages using APT to enhance security and functionality.

### Commands Used  
```bash
sudo apt update  
sudo apt upgrade  
sudo apt autoremove  
sudo apt clean  
sudo apt install openssh-server
```


### Installed Packages  
- OpenSSH Server for secure remote access.

## User Management

### Description  
Managed user accounts by adding, and assigning minimal permissions to ensure least privilege.

### Commands Used  
```bash
sudo adduser 
sudo usermod -aG sudo 
sudo passwd 
```

## Configuring Hostname

### Description  
Changed the systemâ€™s hostname for easier identification.

### Commands Used
```bash
hostname  
sudo hostname  
```

# Securing Remote Access (SSH)

## Part A: Generate SSH Keys

### Description  
Got IP address, generated and installed SSH keys for secure, passwordless login.

### Commands Used  
```bash
hostname -I
ssh-keygen  
ssh-copy-id user@your_ubuntu_ip
```

I won't post my SSH key for the world to see so here's a picture of one of my favorite japanese dogs :)
   
## Part B: Disable Password Authentication and Root Login

### Description  
Configured SSH to enforce key-based authentication and disabled direct root login.

### Commands Used  
Edited SSH configuration file & restarted SSH
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

PasswordAuthentication no  
PermitRootLogin no

sudo systemctl restart ssh  
```

## Key Accomplishments

- Hardened the Ubuntu system against unauthorized access.
- Configured network monitoring with Nmap and net-tools.
- Implemented SSH key-based authentication to enhance remote access security.

---

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: SSH key-based authentication failed during initial setup.  
**Solution:** Corrected `.ssh` directory permissions on the client and server.

### Challenge 2: Incomplete Nmap results due to firewall rules.  
**Solution:** Adjusted firewall to allow full network scans temporarily for documentation.

## Reflection and Future Improvements

### Reflection  
This project deepened my understanding of system hardening, secure remote access, and network monitoring.

### Future Improvements  
- Automate package updates and user management with shell scripts.  
- Integrate with SIEM tools for advanced log analysis.

## Sample Code and Configuration

```bash
# System update and package installation
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install openssh-server nmap net-tools
```

```plaintext
# Example SSH Configuration Changes
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin no
```
